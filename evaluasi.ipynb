      "Jawaban  \n",
      "Answer: In children, chronic kidney disease can result from various etiologies like congenital issues, acquired diseases, genetics, or metabolism. The underlying reason depends on the child's age at first detection of chronic kidney disease. For those under five years old, it usually involves congenital anomalies such as renal hypoplasia or dysplasia, obstructive uropathy, congenital nephrotic syndrome, prune belly syndrome, cortical necrosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, polycystic kidney disease, renal vein thrombosis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. After the age of five, acquired diseases, including different forms of glomerulonephritis like lupus nephritis, dominate. Factors causing kidney damage comprise glomerulosclerosis, formation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, proteinuria, and vascular sclerosis. Risk factors for pediatric chronic kidney disease encompass family history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, low birth weight and prematurity, history of prolonged neonatal hospitalization, kidney dysplasia or hypoplasia, spinal cord tumors or injury, congenital abnormalities of the urinary system, past history of hemolytic uremic syndrome, past history of glomerulopathy, excess weight or obesity, bladder disorders (neurogenic, non-neurogenic, lower urinary tract dysfunction), among others. There are three kinds of prevention strategies for childhood chronic kidney disease - primary prevention, secondary prevention, and tertiary prevention. These involve controlling potential risk factors during pregnancy, infancy, and adolescence respectively. Nephrotoxic drugs should also be avoided during pregnancy. Kidney transplantation may become necessary if kidney functions deteriorate significantly. Criteria for pediatric kidney transplant donors include having normal kidney function within six months prior to surgery and excluding conditions like IgA nephropathy, genetic disorders, diabetes mellitus, active malignancy, and pregnancy during the transplant procedure.\n",

Additionally, they should understand the importance of maintaining optimal cardiovascular health and dealing with potential complications associated with excessive fluid retention due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, patients with conditions like diabetes that increase the likelihood of volume overload or cardiovascular diseases should be aware of possible diuretic resistance and its implications. Before any elective surgeries, patients must ensure proper dialysis status, avoiding dehydration, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia. In case of upcoming postoperative dialysis, a temporary central venous catheter for hemodialysis should ideally be placed prior to surgery, preferring jugular vein access or considering a subclavian approach without contraindications.\n",

      "Answer: Before carrying out the hemodialysis procedure on a child, several preparations need to be made. These include patient selection considering relative contraindications such as severe vascular access problems, heart failure, coagulopathy, unstable hemodynamics, advanced malignancy, conditions related to advanced organ failure like dementia and advanced cirrhosis with encephalopathy, and advanced stage of AIDS. Socio-economic factors also play a role, including access to hemodialysis facilities, family support, and financing. The patient and their family should provide informed consent after understanding the benefits and risks involved in the process. They should prepare for the installation of vascular access for hemodialysis, ideally through the right internal jugular vein. Other necessary arrangements involve having appropriate medical equipment, tools, consumables, and trained personnel. After the procedure, it is crucial to monitor the patient's body weight, laboratory results, and adjusting the target dry weight accordingly. For peritoneal dialysis, certain contraindications should be considered, such as abdominal wall defects, infections, intestinal perforations, bowel adhesions or resections, connections between the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and post-cardiothoracic surgery with oliguria/anuria. In preparing for peritoneal dialysis, a Tenckhoff catheter needs to be prepared based on the child's size, and a specific type of catheter should be chosen depending on the child's condition. Finally, consultation with pediatric urology is recommended for the catheter insertion procedure.\n",

INDICATIONS The decision to initiate dialysis in children varies greatly, depending on remaining kidney function, laboratory values, psychosocial factors, and optimal timing for kidney transplantation. In some European countries, hemodialysis (HD) is more often performed for children over the age of five. HD is not offered to children less than 5 years of age unless there is a substantial contra-indication to peritoneal dialysis (PD). For older children, HD is applied if they stop the PD program or if there is a medical (rare) or psychosocial (more frequent) reason for not undertaking PD.

A multicentre European study has found that the first priority for PD is the child's age (30%), parental choice (27%), distance from the unit (14%), patient choice (11%), social conditions (7%), and no can do one mode (6%). Choosing a mode of dialysis, whether HD or PD, for a child requires consideration, among other factors, of the possible impact of either dialysis mode on the maintenance of residual renal function (RRF), due to its specific impact on patient outcomes. Although there is no general consensus, peritoneal dialysis is associated with less risk of RRF loss. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure (e.g. encephalopathy, seizures, foot drop), pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy. , and hypertension. The side effects of uremia, namely fatigue and weakness, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal symptoms, are relative indications for the initiation of dialysis. PEDIATRIC HEMODIALISIS There are several basic differences between adult and pediatric hemodialysis. For example, in pediatrics, blood flow and hemodialyzers are selected on the basis that children can tolerate 8% (maximum 10%) of their total blood volume in the extracorporeal circuit based on an estimated total blood volume of 80 mL/kg for infants\n",

Optimizing nutrition and growth in children requires a multidisciplinary approach, and is as important as the dialysis process. COMPLICATIONS OF HEMODIALYSIS Hypotension occurs primarily because the movement of water out of the intravascular compartment is faster than the rate of refill of the extracellular and intracellular compartments. The risk of intra-dialytic hypotension depends on various factors, including a rapid decrease in serum osmolality, vasodilation in response to warm dialysate, and a high ultrafiltration rate to correct excess inter-dialytic salt and water consumption. Hemolysis, air embolism, and anaphylactic reactions may also occur. Although rare, disequilibrium syndrome occurs due to a decrease in plasma urea concentration too\n",

Acute complications of hemodialysis include access problems, vascular access infection, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, hypotension, hypertension, cramps, pruritus, and disequilibrium syndrome. Access problems refer to difficulties related to the creation and maintenance of arteriovenous fistulas or grafts. Vascular access infection can lead to sepsis, bacteremia, endocarditis, or staphylococcus aureus infection. Hypovolemia refers to insufficient fluid replacement during hemodialysis leading to dehydration, while hypervolemia indicates excessive fluid removal causing dehydration. Cramps are painful muscle spasms caused by imbalanced electrolytes, whereas pruritus is intense itching resulting from dry skin or disturbed calcium metabolism. Disequilibrium syndrome results from rapid changes in solutes like urea, which causes cerebral edema and other serious complications.\n",

Early detection and intervention are very important to slow disease progression and maintain quality of life, but treatment is often delayed due to lack of awareness among the public and medical personnel. The incidence of CKD in each country is different and is estimated to be higher because many cases are not detected.

      "The primary objectives of perioperative nutritional therapy include maintaining and improving the patient's nutritional status before, during, and after surgery. This involves addressing issues like high C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels, low albumin, significant weight loss, and other factors that contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Early dietary counseling along with support for oral nutritional supplementation, enteral, and parenteral nutrition is recommended. For cases where the gastrointestinal tract is obstructed, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) might be necessary. Monitoring the nutrition status of patients on peritoneal dialysis is crucial, as progressive weight loss could indicate the development of Electrolyte and Fluid Imbalance (EFI). Regular checks on albumin levels in long-term peritoneal dialysis patients are essential since decreasing levels signal a negative prognosis. Parenteral nutrition therapy may be the preferred treatment option for patients experiencing severe digestive symptoms. Furthermore, for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on hemodialysis, intradialytic parenteral nutrition could enhance their nutritional status when oral and enteral intakes fail to meet their requirements. To achieve these goals, various methods are used to assess nutritional status, including intake assessment, anthropometry, body composition analysis, biochemistry tests, nutritional status evaluation, functional status assessment, and recommendations for nutrient intake in hemodialysis patients. These measures aim at preventing excessive metabolic waste buildup, regulating water and electrolyte balance, controlling conditions associated with CKD, and ensuring adequate energy and protein intake for optimal recovery post-surgery.\n",

      "Answer: A surgical patient is considered at risk for severe nutrition if they meet three criteria: evidence of Protein-Energy Wasting (PEW) along with inadequate energy and/or protein intake in their diet; secondly, preventing the buildup of excessive metabolic waste; thirdly, regulating water and electrolyte balance; fourthly, managing health issues associated with chronic kidney disease like anemia, bone disease, and cardiovascular diseases. To assess a patient's nutritional status, various parameters can be used, including intake assessment, anthropometric measurements, body composition analysis, biochemical tests, nutritional status evaluation tools, and functional status assessment. For hemodialysis patients, recommended nutrient intakes include providing 25-35 kilocalories per kilogram of ideal body weight each day, supplying 1.0-1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight daily, and maintaining a balanced fat intake consisting of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and others. Blood transfusions may also be necessary in certain situations, such as hemoglobin levels below 7 g/dl accompanied by symptoms of anemia, hemoglobin levels below 8 g/dl with significant cardiovascular disorders, acute bleeding causing hemodynamic disturbances, or before surgeries. Proper nutritional management during hemodialysis can help alleviate uremia symptoms and manage protein-energy malnutrition effectively. Balancing energy and protein intake according to individual needs plays a crucial role in avoiding severe nutrition risks among these patients.\n",

It is estimated that people with chronic kidney disease have a 10-20 times higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases than those without kidney disease. Several factors contribute to this heightened risk, including traditional cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and diabetes, which often accompany chronic kidney disease, as well as nontraditional risk factors related directly to the kidney disease itself, such as endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and mineral bone disorders. These factors lead to accelerated atherosclerosis and increased susceptibility to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death among individuals with chronic kidney disease.

To prevent this, several efforts must be taken into account, including: a. Recognize and treat nutritional deficiencies and metabolic disorders as early as possible, especially in children with CKD grades 2-5 and children with short stature. Factors that contribute to growth disorders in children with CKD are: 1. Energy and protein malnutrition. Calorie deficiency and protein metabolism disorders are causes of growth disorders in children. Decreased calorie intake is caused by anorexia, emotional stress, taste disorders, nausea and vomiting. 2. Salt wasting Children with renal dysplasia generally experience the most severe obstacles to height gain, which may reflect their age at onset of kidney disease, the degree of tubular abnormalities typical of this condition, as well as the loss of sodium and other substances important for growth. Therefore, salt supplementation should be given to CKD children with polyuria who experience growth restriction. 3.

      "Jawaban  ### Response:\n",
      "To prevent or treat dyslipidemia in CKD children, one should focus on early correction of hypovolemia, aggressive fluid therapy, and maintenance fluids; early treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly within the first two years of life; early management of glomerulopathy involving proteinuria, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia; controlling metabolic syndrome elements like sugar levels, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, and high blood pressure; attending to rarely found diseases. For tertiary prevention, strategies include managing blood pressure, controlling proteinuria, addressing dyslipidemia, diet regulation concerning proteins and phosphate, handling anemia, normalizing vitamin D, dealing with mineral and bone disorders, and regulating metabolic acidosis. In terms of general prevention of CKD in children, it involves comprehensive measures from even before pregnancy in at-risk populations, covering three main aspects - primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Primary prevention targets reducing exposure to risk factors causing kidney disorders and CKD since the fetal stage. Secondary prevention focuses on early recognition and proper treatment of CKD, while tertiary prevention aims to minimize long-term complications due to CKD. Additionally, recognizing and treating nutritional deficiencies and metabolic disorders promptly, specifically in children with CKD grades 2-5 and those with short stature, is crucial to avoid growth failure and undernourishment. Furthermore, maintaining adequate energy and protein intake, ensuring sufficient salt supplements for CKD kids experiencing growth restrictions due to polyuria, and managing renal osteodystrophy contributing to growth disorders are essential steps towards better health outcomes for these children. Some key risk factors for CKD in children include family history of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases; low birth weight and prematurity; history of prolonged hospitalization during the neonatal period; kidney dysplasia or hypoplasia; spinal cord tumors and trauma; congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract; past history of hemolytic uremic syndrome; past history of glomerulopathy; excess weight or obesity; and bladder disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious health problem in children with increasing morbidity and mortality and causing significant socio-economic problems. The main cause of CKD in children is congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, followed by hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure, pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy, and hypertension. Optimizing nutritional status with the support of a dietitian is a basic element of care for children with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. The role of a dietitian is to minimize symptoms of uremia, prevent complications of bone disease due to kidney disorders (renal bone disease), and optimize the child's growth.

      "Answer: Appetite disorders in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients can be caused due to various reasons such as malnutrition, uremic bleeding, uremic pericarditis, uremic neuropathy, and thyroid dysfunction. These complications require specific management strategies to prevent the progression of the disease. Monitoring nutritional status is crucial in CKD patients, where low plasma albumin levels indicate malnutrition. Uremic bleeding might need platelet correction in active bleeding cases or invasive procedures. Uremic pericarditis generally responds quickly to dialysis treatments. Uremic neuropathy may necessitate dialysis initiation depending on its severity. Thyroid dysfunction needs accurate assessment through physical examination along with appropriate vaccinations like influenza virus vaccines for all stages of CKD except initial stages. Additionally, managing the basic causes of CKD, such as ADPKD, diabetic kidney disease, obesity, etc., and treating proteinuria using ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can help manage appetite disorders in CKD patients.\n",

Furthermore, it highlights the importance of monitoring nutritional status, checking thyroid hormone status accurately, and providing suitable vaccinations.

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restriction of sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization. The recommendation for giving calcium is 100% -200% of daily needs according to age. CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency are advised to receive vitamin D by monitoring serum vitamin D3 levels.

It also mentions that for patients with acute illness or significant protein-energy wasting (PEW), the protein intake may need to be increased to over 1.2-1.3 g/kgBW/day. Therefore, a general guideline would suggest a protein intake within the range of 1.0 - 1.2 g/kgBB ideal/day for grade 3 CKD patients aged 4-13 years, but individual cases might require adjustments based on their health condition.\n",

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) defined CKD as a structural or functional kidney abnormality that lasts more than 3 months. However, this definition does not apply to children under 2 years of age, whose nephrons are immature. Also, babies born with congenital kidney anomalies may be diagnosed with CKD before reaching 3 months of age. NKF-KDOQI divides CKD into five stages, namely: Stage 1: kidney damage with normal GFR or increased GFR (≥90 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 2: kidney damage with mild decrease in GFR (60-89 mL/minute /1.73 m²) Stage 3: moderate decrease in GFR (30-59 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 4: severe decrease in GFR (15-29 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 5: kidney failure ( GFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m² or dialysis) An important difference between adult and pediatric end-stage renal disease is the etiology of CKD.

      "\n",
      "Jawaban  ### Response:\n",
      "The impact of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on child growth involves several aspects related to their nutrition and overall health. Firstly, children with CKD may experience malnutrition and growth retardation due to abnormal metabolism, which could lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates among them. To address this issue, maintaining optimal nutritional status is crucial for these children, aiming for a normal growth pattern while ensuring adequate intake of essential micronutrients and macronutrients. Secondly, managing CKD in children requires careful monitoring and adjustment of specific elements such as calcium and phosphate levels, as well as parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, depending on the severity of the condition. Additionally, various risk factors like family history of certain diseases, low birth weight, past medical conditions, and excess weight can contribute to the development and progression of CKD in children. Preventive measures include controlling potential risk factors from pregnancy until childhood, involving specialized professionals like obstetricians and gynecologists when necessary. In summary, CKD affects child growth primarily through its influence on nutrition and metabolism, necessitating proper management and prevention strategies to minimize its impact on their overall health and development.\n",

      "Jawaban  \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "The success of acute hemodialysis is influenced by various factors including proper preparation, facilities, tools, and officers involved in the process. For successful acute hemodialysis, informed consent from both the patient and their family must be obtained, along with the installation of suitable vascular access such as the right internal jugular vein. Before starting the procedure, vital signs need to be measured. Essential facilities include a dedicated HD installation unit room or PICU/ICU, the required equipment like the HD engine, water treatment setup, dialysate and blood lines, a suitable dialyzer based on the child's body surface area, and necessary fluids and medications. Professionally, a doctor in charge of the pediatric patient and a trained dialysis nurse are crucial. During the action procedure, it is essential to weigh the patient before and after hemodialysis to reach the targeted dry weight. Additionally, laboratory tests involving whole blood and measurements of kidney functions (BUN, creatinine) before and after hemodialysis play a significant role in determining the success of the procedure. In cases where there is a risk of ample fluid overload or cardiovascular issues associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), combination diuretic therapies might be employed to manage these conditions prior to any surgeries. Furthermore, if an elective surgical procedure is planned for a patient with CKD, they should ideally be well-dialyzed beforehand, possibly requiring multiple consecutive daily hemodialysis sessions to optimize their condition. Lastly, placing a temporary central venous catheter for hemodialysis before surgery, particularly when postoperative dialysis seems inevitable, could also contribute to the success of acute hemodialysis.\n",

Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for improving the course of chronic kidney disease. Diagnosed patients with stages 1-3 often exhibit no symptoms until stages 4 and 5 when progressive kidney damage leads to high blood pressure due to fluid overload and vasoactive hormone production, symptoms of uremia like lethargy or pericarditis, potentially fatal potassium accumulation causing arrhythmias, anemia resulting from reduced erythropoietin synthesis, imbalances such as hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia due to Vitamin D3 deficiency, and metabolic acidosis stemming from sulfate, phosphate, and uric acid buildup. Blood tests might reveal hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, acidosis, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and increased uric acid levels. Hematuria and proteinuria could be observed in children with chronic kidney disease caused by glomerulonephritis, whereas renal dysplasia results in urine with minimal abnormalities.

      "In summary, ACE inhibitors play a crucial role in managing hypertension in chronic kidney disease patients. They help reduce proteinuria, delay the progression of renal dysfunction, protect against endothelial dysfunction, and decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These drugs work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which leads to vasoconstriction and increased aldosterone secretion. By doing so, they lower blood pressure effectively while minimizing potential adverse effects on the kidneys. Additionally, ACE inhibitors are particularly beneficial when combined with other therapies like calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers. Proper monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and potassium levels is essential during treatment with these medications. Furthermore, lifestyle modifications such as a low-salt diet and regular exercise are important adjuncts to pharmacological interventions in managing hypertension in chronic kidney disease patients.\n",

      "In treating dyslipidemia in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), controlling blood pressure, managing proteinuria, and addressing dietary concerns such as protein and phosphate intake are crucial. Additionally, attention should be given to preventing urinary tract infections during the initial stages of life to avoid potential complications like kidney scarring, which could lead to hypertension, proteinuria, and further progression of CKD. Furthermore, controlling metabolic syndrome elements including sugar levels, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, and blood pressure play a significant role in managing CKD. Lastly, tertiary prevention strategies aim to minimize long-term complications associated with CKD by focusing on various aspects such as blood pressure management, proteinuria control, lipid regulation, diet control, anemia management, vitamin D normalization, mineral and bone disorder control, and acid-base imbalance control.\n",

Vasodilators work by relaxing blood vessels, which helps improve blood flow and reduces pressure within these vessels. This can help manage hypertension effectively. However, since vasolidator drugs may interact negatively with other medications used in CKD management like calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and beta-blockers, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new medication regimen.

      "The recommended daily energy intake for babies aged 0-0.5 years with end-stage renal disease cannot be precisely determined without considering individual factors such as their specific medical condition and nutritional needs. However, it can generally be estimated by calculating the Daily Energy Requirement (DER) using the formula: DER = (weight in kg × 110) + (800 - 900). This value provides an approximate guideline to ensure proper growth and development during this critical period. It's crucial that these calculations are done under professional supervision from healthcare professionals who understand the unique requirements of children with end-stage renal disease.\n"
