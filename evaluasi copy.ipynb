For dialysis patients, the target Hb level ranges from 11-13 g/dL, but for those aged above 65 years, the upper limit is set at 12 g/dL considering the elevated risks of cardiovascular issues and strokes.\n",

      "requires higher heparin doses; Clotting in the circuit occurs more frequently in infants and children weighing <10 kg and in children with low blood flow rates. Although less heparin is required, if accompanied by a decrease in platelet count, the risk of subdural hemorrhage remains increased. Some heparin allergic patients commonly react to porcine products; Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, although rare, can be found when using bovine heparin. Long-term heparin exposure has the potential to cause osteoporosis and may increase the risk of hyperkalemia due to aldosterone inhibition. HEMODIALISIS ALTERNATIVE The hemodiafiltration (HDF) process, a convection method for cleaning toxic substances (a combination of diffusion and ultrafiltration methods) is better than standard hemodialysis. HDF requires good vascular access, with a blood flow rate of 150-240 mL/m2 BSA (Body Surface Area), making it difficult in younger children. To achieve higher flow rates predilutional fluid infusions can be administered; Predilutional hemodiafiltration is more frequently performed in children.

Firstly, their body weight must be checked both before and after the procedure, aiming to reach the desired \"dry weight\" following each session. Secondly, laboratory tests including whole blood samples and measurements of kidney functions such as BUN and creatinine levels should be conducted both prior to and post-hemodialysis. Additionally, alternative dialysis methods like hemodiafiltration (HDF) might be considered for children, especially those who experience difficulties in achieving adequate blood flow rates during conventional hemodialysis. This alternative approach offers better hemodynamic stability and blood pressure regulation, potentially leading to enhanced growth outcomes and removal of larger molecular substances with longer-term implications.\n",

      "Acute complications related to pediatric hemodialysis include intradialytic hypotension characterized by a significant drop in systolic blood pressure relative to the child's age, accompanied by symptoms. This complication may reduce hemodialysis effectiveness if not managed promptly, leading to potential severe consequences. Other acute complications involve hemodialysis catheter dysfunction, which refers to the inability to achieve a blood flow rate greater than the recommended value based on the size of the catheter within the first hour of hemodialysis despite attempts to improve it. Reasons behind this issue could be early catheter failure, advanced catheter failure, or other factors affecting catheter functionality. Moreover, children undergoing hemodialysis might experience various issues such as muscle cramps, chest pain, arrhythmias, shortness of breath, reaction to the dialyzer, and blood leakage. Additionally, they may face complications associated with chronic kidney disease like uncontrolled hyperkalemia, fluid overload, heart failure, pericarditis, uremic encephalopathy, and uremic neuropathy. Furthermore, hemodialysis in children might lead to impaired growth and development. Contraindications for pediatric hemodialysis do not exist. Prior to the procedure, informed consent must be obtained from patients and their families, appropriate vascular access should be installed, vital signs need to be recorded, adequate facilities and supplies must be prepared, and qualified medical staff should be present. The process involves weighing the patient before and after hemodialysis, conducting necessary laboratory tests, and managing any complications that arise during the procedure.\n",

      "The first step in detecting Early Stage Kidney Disease (PKD) involves conducting a urinalysis test, looking for signs such as proteinuria, hematuria, and cellular casts. If any abnormalities are observed, further evaluations will include assessing the severity of proteinuria, undergoing a renal ultrasound, consulting specialists in internal medicine or pediatrics, seeking advice from a kidney specialist, managing hypertension, considering a kidney biopsy if necessary, and monitoring kidney function. Key factors indicating a need for referral to a nephrologist include an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) below 30 milliliters per minute per 1.73 square meters, rapid decline in kidney function, elevated albumin-creatinine ratios above 300mg/g, or finding erythrocyte casts in the urine. Preventive measures target high-risk groups like those with a family history of kidney diseases, individuals aged over 65, hypertensive patients, diabetics, obese persons, those with past cardiovascular issues, and users of certain medications. Screening programs should commence at primary healthcare centers, initially focusing on at-risk populations via case histories, physical examinations, and relevant lab tests including eGFR, serum creatinine, and urine protein checks.\n",

      "A diet rich in fiber has multiple benefits for digestive health. It can prevent constipation by increasing stool bulk and softness, making it easier to pass. Fiber also promotes gut health by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria in the digestive system. Additionally, high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help control blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol. Soluble fiber in these foods slows sugar absorption and binds cholesterol in the intestines.

      "In summary, to reinstall a hemodialysis catheter after infection, certain conditions need to be fulfilled such as having no fever for at least 48-72 hours, obtaining two consecutive negative blood cultures, and returning CRP levels or procalcitonin to normal values. Proper prevention measures like using antiseptic solutions prior to insertion of the dialysis catheter, conducting nasal swab screenings for staphylococci carriers among patients and their companions, and limiting access to hemodialysis catheters to trained personnel play crucial roles in minimizing the risk of infections. For children specifically, early detection through complete blood counts, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin tests, and appropriate culture sampling is essential to guide treatment decisions. Meanwhile, peritoneal dialysis serves as another alternative therapy modality alongside hemodialysis.\n",

      "Monitoring of urine and volume of peritoneal ultrafiltration should be conducted every six months. However, it might need to be done more frequently depending on any specific clinical indicators. These measurements help assess the patient's overall wellbeing including physical examinations, lab results, nutrition status, etc., and contribute to determining their treatment plan. Regular monitoring also helps identify changes in solute transport capacity and ultrafiltration, both of which are crucial for evaluating peritoneal membrane function and adjusting the dialysis dosage accordingly. Moreover, understanding these parameters assists in preventing high solute transport, which is associated with negative clinical outcomes. Furthermore, residual kidney function plays a significant role in predicting the lifespan of patients undergoing dialysis. Changes in peritoneal membrane functions may happen over time, especially within the initial weeks of therapy, thus regular assessment is necessary.\n",

      "The use of hypertonic glucose solution in dialysate fluid should be minimized because it may lead to a faster decline in peritoneal membrane function. Some unfavorable systemic effects associated with hypertonic glucose include weight gain, poor diabetes control, delayed gastric emptying, hyperinsulinemia, and adverse hemodynamic effects. Additionally, replacing high glucose solutions with icodextrin for extended periods helps avoid these systemic effects caused by glucose loads. Studies show that icodextrin has a lesser association with peritoneal damage in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. It increases ultrafiltration and decreases episodes of fluid overload without affecting residual renal function. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis recommends using icodextrin to enhance ultrafiltration independently of dialysate-to-plasma (D/P) creatinine levels, posing no apparent risks of detrimental side effects or influence on the RRF. To maintain kidney function in CAPD patients, managing fluid management and applying appropriate treatment strategies are crucial since rapid fluid removal during peritoneal dialysis procedures and fluctuating pressures might contribute to the loss of residual kidney function.\n",

      "Preventing infections in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (DAP) requires multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals, including nurses, ward doctors, and microbiology specialists. Regular evaluations should be conducted to monitor and prevent infections. Patients and their families need education on maintaining cleanliness to ensure independent DAP procedures are free from contamination. Prevention of dialysis catheter-related infections, such as exit site or tunnel infections, involves several measures. These include using immobilizers or tape to protect the catheter from the abdominal wall, applying topical antibacterials and antiseptics like povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine solution, mupirocin ointment, gentamicin ointment, and ciprofloxacin eye drops, and ensuring proper catheter care through regular cleaning. Antifungal prophylaxis during DAP sessions, along with regular exit site cleaning, also helps prevent fungal peritonitis. Periodic assessments for infections like peritonitis and other focal infections should be performed, involving cooperation with microbiology and infection control teams to establish optimal treatment and prevention protocols. Additionally, patients should receive annual reviews about their dialysis methods, undergoing intensive retraining if necessary, and initial catheter insertion should involve prophylactic antibiotics administration.\n",

      "Jawaban  ### Response:\n",
      "To detect acute rejection in kidney transplant patients during the early phase, one must suspect the condition in individuals with a functioning transplanted kidney who experience an increase in plasma creatinine of over 25% within 1-2 days. This may accompany decreased urine volume, tenderness at the site of the transplanted kidney, fever, and no other cause identified affecting the kidney function. Risk factors for acute rejection involve retranstplantation, donor age above 50 years, female donors, high numbers of HLA mismatches, delayed onset of graft function, younger recipients, African American ethnicity (in the United States), elevated panel reactive antibody (PRA), presence of specific antibodies against the donor, blood group incompatibility, duration of cold ischemia exceeding 24 hours, and renal biopsy should be performed in cases with suspected acute rejection. Treatment for acute rejection is typically administered even in subclinical or borderline instances. The incidence of acute rejection varies between 10%-50% within the first six months, contingent upon suitable HLA matching and immunosuppressive therapy. Acute rejection is a significant complication in kidney transplantation and is one of the primary risk factors for developing chronic rejection. Precise and quick detection and management of both acute and chronic rejections are crucial due to chronic rejection being the leading cause of kidney transplant failure in the later stages. Postoperative care of kidney transplantation comprises two phases - the initial phase aimed at preventing acute rejection and the subsequent phase focused on maintaining graft functionality and averting long-term consequences of immunosuppressive drugs like malignancies, infections, and cardiovascular diseases. These two phases transition between three to six months following progressive reduction of immunosuppressive medication according to protocol and within maintenance levels.\n",

For fat, it is recommended that fat intake not exceed 30% of the total calories consumed. If serum TG levels are high, it is recommended to consume low amounts of fat. For serum LDL-C levels above 100 mg/dL, limit cholesterol intake to less than 200 mg/day. For serum LDL-C levels above 100 mg/dL , Avoid intake of trans fatty acids. For serum LDL-C levels above 100 mg/dL, saturated fatty acid intake should be less than 7% of total calories.

      "To prevent or treat dyslipidemia in pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD), several measures can be taken. These include limiting sugar intake, using healthy oils like soybean, corn, or unsaturated fats for cooking; consuming fresh or frozen vegetables and canned fruits cautiously (avoid added sugars); incorporating fish into the diet frequently; removing chicken skin; choosing lean meats; restricting high-calorie sauces; following a high-fiber, low-salt, and low-sugar diet. In cases where protein, mineral, and electrolyte intake is restricted due to CKD management, further lipid limitations may help reduce overall calorie intake. However, for normal nutritional status children with CKD, dietary interventions for dyslipidemia aren't typically advised unless focusing on a balanced fat diet suitable for general cardiac health. For overweight or obese children with CKD stages 2-5 or 5D, lifestyle modifications and lipid restrictions aiming at controlling body weight are suggested. Specifically, for elevated serum Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels beyond 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), there are no particular calorie guidelines. When triglycerides (TG) levels surpass 150 mg/dL linked to excess weight, balancing caloric intake with physical activity for weight loss is advisable. Limiting fat intake to below 30% of total calorie consumption is generally recommended. Further reductions in fat intake might be necessary when TG levels are high. To manage elevated serum LDL-C levels above 100 mg/dL, restrict daily cholesterol intake under 200 mg. Abstain from ingesting trans fatty acids when dealing with increased serum LDL-C levels above 100 mg/dL. Lastly, decrease saturated fatty acid intake to less than 7% of total calorie consumption when facing elevated serum LDL-C levels above 100 mg/dL. Additionally, minimize simple carbohydrate intake when managing high serum TG levels above 150 mg/dL\n",

Long-term heparin exposure has the potential to cause osteoporosis and may increase the risk of hyperkalemia due to aldosterone inhibition. HEMODIALISIS ALTERNATIVE The hemodiafiltration (HDF) process, a convection method for cleaning toxic substances (a combination of diffusion and ultrafiltration methods) is better than standard hemodialysis. HDF requires good vascular access, with a blood flow rate of 150-240 mL/m2 BSA (Body Surface Area), making it difficult in younger children. To achieve higher flow rates predilutional fluid infusions can be administered; Predilutional hemodiafiltration is more frequently performed in children. The benefits of HDF for children include improved hemodynamic stability and better blood pressure control with fewer episodes of intra-dialysis hypotension and improved growth. Removal of medium-sized molecules and phosphate may help reduce long-term effects\n",

Optimizing nutrition and growth in children requires a multidisciplinary approach, and is as important as the dialysis process. COMPLICATIONS OF HEMODIALYSIS Hypotension occurs primarily because the movement of water out of the intravascular compartment is faster than the rate of refill of the extracellular and intracellular compartments. The risk of intra-dialytic hypotension depends on various factors, including a rapid decrease in serum osmolality, vasodilation in response to warm dialysate, and a high ultrafiltration rate to correct excess inter-dialytic salt and water consumption. Hemolysis, air embolism, and anaphylactic reactions may also occur. Although rare, disequilibrium syndrome occurs due to a decrease in plasma urea concentration too\n",

      "quickly compared to the reduction in brain potassium concentration. This leads to cerebral edema and neurological symptoms. In addition, there are complications related to anticoagulation therapy, such as bleeding or clot formation. Anticoagulant use during hemodialysis is necessary to prevent clot formation within the extracorporeal circulation. However, some patients have contraindications to anticoagulation, leading to the need for regional citrate anticoagulation. Citrate acts as an antioxidant and chelating agent, preventing oxidative stress and metal-induced damage to biomolecules.\n",

Before performing the procedure, informed consent must be obtained from the patient or their family after explaining the benefits and potential complications of hemodialysis. Vascular access for hemodialysis is recommended through the right internal jugular vein, and vital signs must be measured prior to the procedure. Facilities and equipment required include a hemodialysis unit room or PICU/ICU, hemodialysis machine, water treatment system, dialysate and blood lines, appropriate dialyzer size based on the child's body surface area, necessary fluids and medications, and medical staff consisting of a doctor in charge of the child patient and a dialysis nurse. During the procedure, it is essential to monitor the patient's body weight before and after hemodialysis, perform laboratory tests before and after hemodialysis, and evaluate the patient's overall condition, including blood pressure, post-treatment blood test results, and heart function assessment. After the procedure, it is crucial to ensure adequate hemodialysis based on fluid balance status, proper electrolyte and acid-base balance, effective management of bone mineral disorders, good growth and development progress, and achievement of patient-oriented goals related to quality of life.\n",

      "Acute complications related to pediatric hemodialysis include intradialytic hypotension characterized by a significant drop in systolic blood pressure relative to the child's age, accompanied by symptoms. This complication may reduce hemodialysis effectiveness if not managed promptly, leading to potential severe consequences. Other acute complications involve hemodialysis catheter dysfunction, which refers to the inability to achieve a blood flow rate greater than the recommended value based on the size of the catheter within the first hour of hemodialysis despite attempts to improve it. Reasons behind this issue could be early catheter failure, advanced catheter failure, or other factors affecting catheter functionality. Moreover, children undergoing hemodialysis might experience various issues such as muscle cramps, chest pain, arrhythmias, shortness of breath, reaction to the dialyzer, and blood leakage. Additionally, they may face complications associated with chronic kidney disease like uncontrolled hyperkalemia, fluid overload, heart failure, pericarditis, uremic encephalopathy, and uremic neuropathy. Furthermore, hemodialysis in children may lead to impaired growth and development. Contraindications for pediatric hemodialysis do not exist. Prior to the procedure, informed consent must be obtained from patients and their families, appropriate vascular access should be installed, vital signs need to be recorded, adequate facilities and supplies must be prepared, and qualified medical staff should be present. The process involves weighing the patient before and after hemodialysis, conducting necessary laboratory tests, and managing any complications that arise during the procedure.\n",

      "In summary, to reinstall a hemodialysis catheter after an infection, certain conditions need to be fulfilled such as having no fever for at least 48-72 hours, obtaining two consecutive negative blood cultures, and returning CRP levels or procalcitonin to normal values. Proper prevention measures like using antiseptic solutions prior to insertion of the dialysis catheter, conducting nasal swab screenings for staphylococci carriers among patients and their companions, and limiting access to hemodialysis catheters to trained personnel play crucial roles in minimizing the risk of infections. For children specifically, early detection through complete blood counts, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin tests, and appropriate culture sampling should be conducted to rule out any potential abscesses caused by infection spread. Treatment strategies depend on the type of infection and may involve adjustments to antibiotic regimens. Ultimately, catheter removal might be necessary under specific circumstances such as unresponsiveness to adequate antibiotic therapy within a specified timeframe or the presence of severe complications including sepsis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, widespread infection, or resistant pathogens.\n",

      "To prevent or treat dyslipidemia in pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD), several measures can be taken. These include limiting sugar intake, using soybean, corn, or unsaturated oils for cooking, consuming fresh or frozen vegetables and canned fruits cautiously (avoiding added sugars), incorporating fish into the diet frequently, removing chicken skin, choosing lean meats, restricting high-calorie sauces like cheese and cream, following a high-fiber, low-salt, and low-sugar diet. In cases where protein, mineral, and electrolyte intake is restricted to manage uremia and other CKD complications, further lipid restrictions may help reduce overall calorie intake. However, for normal nutritional status children with CKD, implementing dietary interventions specifically for dyslipidemia isn't recommended; instead, they should follow a balanced fat diet suitable for general cardiac health. For overweight or obese children with CKD stages 2-5 or 5D, lifestyle modifications and lipid restrictions aiming to control body weight are advised. Specifically, for elevated serum Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels beyond 100mg/dL, there aren't particular calorie guidelines. When triglycerides (TG) levels surpass 150mg/dL due to excess weight, balancing caloric intake with physical activity for weight loss is suggested. Fat intake shouldn't exceed 30% of total calories consumed, and when TG levels are high, fat consumption should be minimal. To address elevated serum LDL-C levels above 100mg/dL, limit daily cholesterol intake below 200mg, avoid trans fatty acids, and keep saturated fatty acid intake under 7% of total calories. Lastly, for increased serum TG levels, reduce simple carbohydrate consumption.\n",

      "The goals of nutritional therapy can be achieved with nutritional counseling and individual assessment. Interventions are carried out based on the results of assessments of nutritional status, age, development, food choices, beliefs and psychosocial status. Children with CKD need to be evaluated periodically with nutritional modifications. Evaluations are more often carried out for worsening CKD, the presence of comorbidities that affect growth, and diseases that cause impaired nutritional status. Nutritional therapy is carried out in collaboration between pediatricians, pediatric nurses, nutritionists and a team of pediatric nephrologists. EPIDEMIOLOGY The average incidence of CKD in children in the world is 12.1 cases per 1,000,000 children. The incidence of CKD at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in 1986-1988 was 21 out of 252 children6. The incidence of end-stage renal failure in children in America, New Zealand, Austria and Japan respectively is 14.8; 13.6; 12.4; and 4 per 1,000,000 children. One of the causes of the difference in incidence rates is the existence of screening programs and the ease of kidney transplantation5. The most common cause of CKD in children under five years of age is congenital abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary tract, including renal dysplasia, renal hypoplasia, and obstructive uropathy due to posterior urethral valves. In children over five years old, CKD is most often caused by acquired diseases, such as glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections. THERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS In 2008,\n",

      "Anemia in Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is typically diagnosed when hemoglobin levels fall below specific thresholds depending on the child's age. For children aged 6 months to 5 years, anemia is diagnosed if their hemoglobin level is less than 11.0 g/dL. For those aged 5 to 12 years, anemia diagnosis occurs if their hemoglobin level is lower than 11.5 g/dL. To diagnose anemia in older children and adults, hemoglobin levels should be below 12.0 g/dL for females and 13.0 g/dL for males. Anemia in CKD is primarily identified after ruling out other non-renal factors causing anemia. A thorough examination includes evaluating red blood cell indices, absolute reticulocyte counts, serum iron levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, white blood cell numbers and differentiation, platelet count, vitamin B12 levels (if increased Mean corpuscular volume), and serum folate (if increased mean corpuscular volume). Before starting erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment, efforts should be made to optimize the patient's erythropoiesis response while ensuring sufficient iron status. In pediatric CKD, nutritional therapy plays a crucial role and involves periodic assessments and adjustments according to the child's nutritional status, age, dietary preferences, beliefs, and psychosocial aspects. Collaborative care among pediatricians, pediatric nurses, nutritionists, and pediatric nephrology teams is essential. The global prevalence of childhood CKD is approximately 12.1 cases per million children, with varying incidences across regions influenced by screening programs and accessibility to kidney transplantation. Congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies are the leading cause of CKD in young children, whereas acquired conditions like glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections dominate in older kids. Treatment recommendations may vary depending on the stage and underlying cause of CKD.\n",

Energy needs depend on factors such as age, gender, degree of muscle mass, level of physical activity, severity of illness, and presence of complications. The recommended energy intake for children with CKD is calculated based on the Harris-Benedict equation. 5. Vitamins and minerals. Micronutrients play an essential role in maintaining good health. However, excessive consumption of certain vitamins and minerals can cause toxic effects. Therefore, micronutrient supplementation must be adjusted according to the patient's condition. For example, vitamin D supplementation is needed to maintain bone health and prevent rickets in children with CKD stages 3-5. Similarly, iron supplementation may be required if the child has anemia caused by chronic disease. 6. Protein needs. Protein is one of the most important components of the diet. It plays a vital role in building muscles, tissues, organs, enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. However, excessive protein intake can lead to waste products accumulating in the bloodstream, causing damage to kidneys. Therefore, protein intake should be limited in children with CKD. The amount of protein consumed depends on the stage of CKD. 7. Bone health. Children with CKD are at risk of developing osteoporosis and other bone diseases. Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin D are important elements for maintaining bone health. Monitoring and managing these elements is crucial in preventing bone disease. 8. Fluid needs and electrolytes. Fluids and electrolyte imbalances occur in children with CKD. Fluid restriction is necessary to reduce the workload on the kidney. Electrolyte balance is also important to ensure proper functioning of cells, nerves, and muscles.\n",

The aim of nutritional therapy for children with CKD is to achieve normal growth and development through providing adequate nutrition. The parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD are: a. Food intake Food intake needs to be considered in order to achieve optimal growth. Adequacy of food intake is assessed by recording and evaluating for three consecutive days. b. Height/body length percentile for age Height/body length assessment was carried out using the WHO standard growth curve for children from birth to five years of age and the CDC growth curve for children over five years of age.

Treatment options for renal osteodystrophy include phosphorus and vitamin D supplementation, calcimimetics, bisphosphonates, and parathyroidectomy. 1. Anemia Anemia due to chronic kidney disease is common and can lead to fatigue, weakness, and poor exercise capacity. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) such as darbepoetin alfa and epoetin alfa have been used to increase hemoglobin levels and improve quality of life in CKD patients. However, ESAs also carry risks such as hypertension, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, and worsening kidney function. 2. Acid-base imbalance Metabolic acidosis occurs frequently in CKD patients due to impaired renal excretion of hydrogen ions and ammonia. This acid-base imbalance can affect various aspects of health, including growth, bone mineralization, muscle strength, and cognitive development. Alkaline reserve supplementation with sodium citrate or potassium citrate can help correct metabolic acidosis in CKD patients. 3. Cardiovascular Disease CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and arrhythmias. Management strategies for CVD in CKD patients include controlling high blood pressure, managing lipids, and using antiplatelet medications. 4.

      "The interval for nutritional assessment for children aged 1-3 years with chronic kidney disease varies depending on the stage of their condition. For children with CKD grade 2-3, the recommended frequency is once every 1-3 months. For those with CKD grade 4-5 without dialysis, it should be done every 1-2 months. If they are undergoing dialysis treatment (CKD 5D), the assessment should occur at least once every 1-2 months. The specific parameters assessed include height and growth velocity percentiles, estimated dry weight and weight percentiles, body mass index, and head circumference percentiles. Additionally, the macronutrient requirements for this age group are typically set between 45% to 65% carbohydrates, 30% to 40% fats, and 5% to 20% proteins. Calcium intake recommendations vary by age, but generally do not exceed 1000mg per day for children up to 9 years old. Vitamin D supplementation is also important, with a daily dose of 400 IU for infants under one year and 600-1000 IU for older children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restricting sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization. The recommendation for giving calcium is 100% -200% of daily needs according to age. CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency are advised to receive vitamin D by monitoring serum vitamin D3 levels.

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restricting sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization.

In some European countries, hemodialysis (HD) is more often performed for children over the age of five. HD is not offered to children less than 5 years of age unless there is a substantial contra-indication to peritoneal dialysis (PD).

The main cause of CKD in children is congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, followed by hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure, pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy, and hypertension. Optimizing nutritional status with the support of a dietitian is a basic element of care for children with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. The role of a dietitian is to minimize symptoms of uremia, prevent complications of bone disease due to kidney disorders (renal bone disease), and optimize the child's growth.

Choosing a dialysis mode, whether HD or PD, for a child requires consideration, among other factors, of the possible impact of either dialysis mode on the maintenance of residual renal function (RRF), due to its specific impact on patient outcomes. Although there is no general consensus, peritoneal dialysis is associated with less risk of RRF loss.

The side effects of uremia, namely fatigue and weakness, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal symptoms, are relative indications for the initiation of dialysis.

      "dominant. The main cause of CKD in children is congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in around 50%, followed by hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. The etiology of CKD varies by age and race, children younger than 12 years are more likely to have CAKUT; Glomerular-based disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is more likely in black adolescents. Obesity in children is an emerging problem worldwide, and recent studies have identified early renal dysfunction and risk of CKD in obese children. In addition, low birth weight babies and short gestational ages increase the risk of end-stage renal disease in adolescence. CLINICAL FEATURES Clinical manifestations that are often found in CKD in children are: 1. Growth Disorders Growth disorders are common and perhaps the most frequently seen in children with CKD. The degree of growth impairment increased as GFR decreased, although significant reductions in growth were seen at all levels of renal function. The causes of growth disorders are believed to be multifactorial, including the function of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), nutritional status, acid-base balance, and bone mineralization.

      "KDOQI) in 2002, is a kidney disease with kidney damage for at least three months with or without a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) defined CKD as a structural or functional kidney abnormality that lasts more than 3 months. However, this definition does not apply to children under 2 years of age, whose nephrons are immature. Also, babies born with congenital kidney anomalies may be diagnosed with CKD before reaching 3 months of age. NKF-KDOQI divides CKD into five stages, namely: Stage 1: kidney damage with normal GFR or increased GFR (≥90 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 2: kidney damage with mild decrease in GFR (60-89 mL/minute /1.73 m²) Stage 3: moderate decrease in GFR (30-59 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 4: severe decrease in GFR (15-29 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 5: kidney failure ( GFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m² or dialysis) An important difference between adult and pediatric end-stage renal disease is the etiology of CKD.

The potential benefits of dialysate individualization must be balanced against the problems of storing different dialysate electrolyte solutions, errors in dialysate composition, machine proportioning, and nursing program errors. Many dialysis units choose to standardize dialysate composition to reduce costs and programming errors. BLOOD ACCESS AND CIRCULATION The success of chronic hemodialysis depends on good vascular access: internal arteriovenous fistula (AVF), shunt (AVS), graft (AVG), or central venous catheter. Newborn babies can be dialyzed through the umbilical vein using an umbilical vein catheter. In older children, percutaneous cannulation of the femoral vein is the method of choice. One or two femoral veins are connected using the Setdinger technique. If you have to use two catheters in a small child, it is easier to catheterize each femoral vein than to insert two catheters on the same side.

The main cause of CKD in children is congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, followed by hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure, pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy, and hypertension. Optimizing nutritional status with the support of a dietitian is a basic element of care for children with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. The role of a dietitian is to minimize symptoms of uremia, prevent complications of bone disease due to kidney disorders (renal bone disease), and optimize the child's growth.

      "The common causes of pediatric chronic kidney disease below 5 years old involve structural or functional abnormalities of the kidney. These may include congenital issues like renal hypoplasia or dysplasia, obstructive uropathy, congenital nephrotic syndrome, prune belly syndrome, cortical necrosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, polycystic kidney disease, renal vein thrombosis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. In older children above 5 years, acquired diseases such as various forms of glomerulonephritis become more prevalent. Early diagnosis and management are crucial to mitigate the rising morbidity and mortality rates associated with childhood chronic kidney disease.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restriction of sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization. The recommendation for giving calcium is 100% -200% of daily needs according to age. CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency are advised to receive vitamin D by monitoring serum vitamin D3 levels.

According to Dietary Reference Intakes, a healthy child within this age range would require about 0.95 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. However, for a child with stage 3 CKD, they may need between 1.2 to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. In case of stage 4-5 CKD, it could be between 1.2 and 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.

      "The appropriate dose of EPO in CKD patients with anemia depends on their specific situation and disease progression. Regular monitoring of Hemoglobin (Hb) levels is crucial for determining the right treatment approach. For CKD stages 3 to 5 not undergoing hemodialysis, Hb concentrations should be examined at least every three months; however, those undergoing dialysis need monthly assessments. In general, anemia diagnosis in CKD patients begins with ruling out other non-renal factors contributing to anemia. A comprehensive evaluation includes red blood cell indices, absolute reticulocyte counts, serum iron levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, white blood cell counts, platelet counts, vitamin B12 levels (if necessary), serum folate levels, and fecal occult blood tests. Before initiating Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent (ESA) therapy like Epoetin and Darbepoetin Alpha, it is essential to ensure adequate iron status. These therapies can effectively manage anemia in CKD patients, including those who have not yet started dialysis.\n",

      "The management of dyslipidemia in pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis involves several approaches. Firstly, reducing sugars, including sugary drinks and juices, helps manage hypertriglyceridemia. Secondly, using soybean oil, corn, or unsaturated fats for cooking is advised instead of other oils. Thirdly, consuming fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits in cans (avoid those with added sugar) provides essential nutrients while managing dyslipidemia. Fourthly, incorporating fish into their diet frequently offers cardioprotection benefits. Fifthly, removing chicken skin prior to consumption reduces unhealthy fats. Sixthly, opting for lean meats minimizes saturated fat intake. Seventhly, limiting high-calorie sauces like cheese sauce and cream contributes to better lipid profiles. Eighthly, choosing whole grain bread and cereals over other carbohydrates supports healthy lipid levels. Ninthly, substituting nuts and tofu for meat also promotes balanced lipid levels. Lastly, reading food labels, particularly focusing on bread, cereal, processed meals, and selecting a diet rich in fiber, low in salt, and sugar further assists in maintaining optimal lipid levels. In cases where protein, mineral, and electrolyte intakes are restricted due to uremic control and various CKD complications, additional lipid limitations may help decrease overall caloric intake. However, for normal nutritional status children with CKD, dietary interventions specifically targeting dyslipidemia aren't typically recommended unless addressing general heart-healthy diets. For overweight and obese children with CKD stages 2-5 and 5D, lifestyle modifications along with lipid restriction contribute to weight control. Specific KDOQI recommendations for dyslipidemia in CKD stage 5, 5D, and post-transplantation include controlling calorie intake relative to physical activity when elevated triglycerides relate to excess weight; restricting fat intake to under 30% of total calories, decreasing fat in case of high triglyceride levels; limiting daily cholesterol intake below 200mg; avoiding trans fatty acids; keeping saturated fatty acid\n",

Sodium: For all age groups, sodium generally does not need to be limited , but can reach 1-3 mEq/kg BW per day if edema or hypertension occurs. Potassium: Potassium usually does not need to be limited until kidney function levels (GFR) are less than 10% of normal, with an amount of around 1-3 mEq/kg BW if needed. Calcium: Babies (0-1 years) need around 400 mg/day for ages 0-0.5 years, and 600 mg/day for ages 0.5-1 years. Toddlers (1-3 years) need around 800 mg/day. Children (3-10 years) need around 800 mg/day. Adolescents (11-18 years) need around 1200 mg/day. This applies if there is no hypercalcemia and the calcium-phosphorus product does not exceed 70. Phosphorus: For all age groups, use a low-phosphorus formula if serum phosphate levels are elevated, and avoid foods high in phosphorus. Approximately 600-800 mg/day is usually required when serum phosphate levels rise. Vitamins: For all age groups, administer multivitamins if necessary.

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious health problem in children with increasing morbidity and mortality and causing significant socio-economic problems. The main cause of CKD in children is congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, followed by hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure, pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy, and hypertension. Optimizing nutritional status with the support of a dietitian is a basic element of care for children with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. The role of a dietitian is to minimize symptoms of uremia, prevent complications of bone disease due to kidney disorders (renal bone disease), and optimize the child's growth.

Stage 2 indicates a slight reduction in GFR, but the patient does not show any symptoms. At stage 3, the GFR has decreased significantly, but it is still possible for the patient to live normally. However, at this stage, complications such as hypertension and anemia often begin to arise. In stage 4, patients have significant reductions in GFR and require dialysis or transplantation.

      "Jawaban:\n",
      "Signs and symptoms of kidney damage vary depending on the individual and how their kidneys respond to injury. Kidney damage can result from various conditions including high blood pressure, diabetes, other diseases affecting the whole body, inflammation of the kidneys, inherited disorders, and kidney stones. Adaptive hyperfiltration occurs when healthy kidney function increases to compensate for damaged areas, which might lead to normal or near-normal serum creatinine levels in mild kidney insufficiency cases. A gradual decline in function characterizes chronic kidney disease, marked by a reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). As kidney function deteriorates, they become unable to eliminate toxins effectively, leading to potential consequences like anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system issues ranging from loss of concentration to seizures and coma, excess fluid volume, hyperkalemia, metabolic acids, hypertension, anemia, and mineral and bone disorders. Other signs include hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, acidosis, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased uric acid levels, and potentially hypoalbuminemia in those with severe proteinuria. Anemia is also common, showing normochromic and normocytic complete blood counts. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels typically increase. Abnormalities in hematuria and proteinuria may appear in urinalysis, particularly in children with glomerulonephrit\n",

      "A diet rich in fiber has multiple benefits for digestive health. It can prevent constipation by increasing stool bulk and softness, making it easier to pass. Fiber also promotes gut health by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria in the digestive system. Additionally, high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help control blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol. Soluble fiber in these foods slows sugar absorption and binds cholesterol in the intestines.

      "Before performing hemodialysis on a child, several preparations need to be made involving the patient and their family, facilities and infrastructure, tools and supplies, and officers involved. During the procedure, the child's weight should be checked before and after the dialysis, and efforts should be made to achieve the target dry weight after each session. Required lab tests should be conducted both prior to and following the hemodialysis. After the procedure, blood pressure monitoring, examination of blood test outcomes, and heart function evaluation are necessary. In terms of peritoneal dialysis preparation, all patients should receive proper education on renal replacement therapy management from trained medical professionals. For children undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), they must be prepared for establishing permanent catheter access, considering factors such as catheter type, location, and patient preferences. Early referrals and assessments for insertion sites are crucial for those planning to begin CAPD.\n",

      "Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI) refers to a specific type of bloodstream infection occurring in patients with hemodialysis catheters. It is one of the potential complications related to these catheters, along with exit site infections and tunnel infections. The diagnosis of CRBSI involves identifying a primary bloodstream infection in individuals undergoing hemodialysis through a catheter. This condition is classified into three categories: definite, probable, and possible CRBSI based on various criteria such as positive blood cultures containing pathogenic bacteria, accompanying signs and symptoms of infection, positive blood cultures alongside bacteria found in skin surfaces, improvement of symptoms upon antibiotic treatment or after catheter removal without positive culture results in the patient, among others. The risk of developing a hemodialysis catheter infection is significantly higher than those using alternative kidney substitution therapies like arteriovenous fistulas. Non-tunneled catheters have a higher frequency of CRBSI compared to tunneled ones. Other contributing factors may involve certain demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and procedural aspects during catheter insertion. Management strategies for CRBSI vary depending on the severity and response to initial treatments. In some cases, maintaining the catheter with appropriate antibiotic administration might suffice, whereas catheter removal could be necessary when there's worsening hemodynamics, persistent bacteremia despite 72 hours of systemic antibiotic therapy, or concurrent tunnel infection. Regular monitoring and culturing practices aid in determining the most effective course of action. To prevent CRBSI, healthcare providers should follow standard precautions and guidelines, including preoperative antiseptic measures, nasal staphylococci screening, prophylactic antibiotics (particularly local applications), and limiting access to hemodialysis catheters exclusively to trained personnel. For children specifically, diagnostic approaches and treatment plans for peritoneal dialysis catheter infections also apply to hemodialysis catheter infections.\n",

      "The use of hypertonic glucose dialysate fluid should be avoided because it may lead to decreased peritoneal membrane function. High solute transport can result in increased mortality or technical failure in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PPE), especially when using high rates of icodextrin. Hypertonic glucose fluids can also have some unfavorable systemic effects on patients, such as weight gain, poor glycemic control, delayed gastric emptying, hyperinsulinemia, and adverse hemodynamic effects. It is advised to minimize the use of hypertonic glucose by enhancing residual diuresis through diuretics like furosemide 250 mg daily. Instead of glucose solutions, replacing them with icodextrin for extended durations helps avoid systemic effects caused by glucose loads while maintaining equivalent ultrafiltration. Studies show that icodextrin has lesser association with peritoneal membrane damage in automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis recommends using icodextrin to boost ultrafiltration independently of dialysate/plasma (D/P) creatinine levels without any apparent detrimental risks or influence on residual renal function. To maintain kidney function in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, managing fluid balance and applying appropriate treatment strategies are crucial since rapid fluid removal and pressure fluctuations during the process can contribute to reduced residual kidney function.\n",

Regular monitoring and considering changing the dialysis method if ultrafiltration is less than 750 ml daily is crucial for patients with persistent anuria. Preventing infectious complications requires multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals like nurses, ward doctors, and microbiology specialists. Education about maintaining cleanliness should be provided to patients and their families to ensure independent and infection-free DAP implementation.\n",

      "Preventing dialysis catheter-related infections, such as exit site infection or tunnel infection, involves various recommendations. These include cleaning the exit site at least twice a week and after each shower, cleaning the exit site daily when an infection occurs, and providing antifungal prophylaxis along with antibiotics for peritonitis prevention. Periodic assessments for infections like peritonitis and other focal infections should be conducted, involving microbiology and infection control teams for optimal treatment and prevention protocol development.\n",

      "Regular reviews of the dialysis technique should take place at least once a year or more often if there's evidence of inadequate procedure technique or DAP-related infections or significant issues affecting the patient post-DP. Intensity of training should also be increased using the flush-before-fill system, administering prophylactic antibiotics during initial catheter insertion, and preventing focal infections from the exit site. Screening for Staphylococcus aureus via nasal swab prior to catheter insertion is advised, followed by appropriate interventions depending on local guidelines and expert consultation. Both mupirocin and gentamicin have shown effectiveness in preventing infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas, so this approach should be considered.\n",

      "To detect acute rejection in kidney transplant patients during the early phase, one must suspect the condition in individuals with a previously functioning transplanted kidney experiencing a rise in plasma creatinine level beyond 25% within 1-2 days. Risk factors for acute rejection involve retranstplantation, donor age over 50 years, female donors, high numbers of HLA mismatches, delayed onset of graft function, younger recipients, African American ethnicity (in the U.S.), panel reactive antibody (PRA), presence of specific antibodies against the donor, blood group incompatibility, duration of cold ischemia exceeding 24 hours, and various other factors. In cases with clinically diagnosed acute rejection, a renal biopsy should be conducted before initiating treatment. Treatment for acute rejection may also be administered for subclinical or borderline instances. The incidence of acute rejection varies between 10%-50% within the first six months, contingent upon suitable HLA matching and immunosuppressive therapy. Acute rejection is a significant contributor to chronic rejection, which is the primary reason behind kidney transplant failures in the later stages. Consequently, swift and accurate detection and management of both acute and chronic rejections are crucial. Postoperative management of kidney transplantation encompasses two phases: (1) the initial phase aimed at preventing acute rejection, and (2) the subsequent phase focused on maintaining graft functionality and averting long-term consequences related to immunosuppressive drugs like malignancies, infections, and cardiovascular diseases. This transition typically takes place between three to six months following progressive reduction of immunosuppressive medications according to established protocols and within maintenance levels. Additionally, patient preparations prior to kidney transplantation entail an array of evaluations, including medical histories, comprehensive physical examinations, laboratory tests, specialized radiological investigations, and additional inspections to identify sources of infection. Moreover, pre-transplant nutrition status significantly influences post-transplant results. To sum up, detecting acute rejection in kidney transplant patients involves identifying risk factors, conducting necessary diagnostic procedures, and treating accordingly while monitoring for potential complications.\n",

      "Jawaban:\n",
      "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may face an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases due to underlying risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, CKD itself serves as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Managing chronic kidney disease aims to address the primary causes of kidney disorders, control or minimize comorbidities, prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function, manage metabolic disorders linked to chronic kidney disease, prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases, and optimize growth and development in children. Treatment of hypertension through angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors helps safeguard remaining nephrons and slows the deterioration of kidney function. Restricting fluid and sodium intake can also help alleviate issues related to CKD. Furthermore, patients with CKD require evaluation to diagnose the type of kidney disease, identify comorbid conditions, ascertain the stage of kidney damage based on GFR, evaluate complications tied to GFR levels, and consider risk factors affecting reduced kidney function and those pertinent to cardiovascular diseases. In terms of anesthesia risks on the cardiovascular system and kidneys in CKD patients, there are two key aspects to consider - cardiovascular risks and renal risks. Cardiovascular risk assessment and management are crucial for CKD patients because they are prone to a higher prevalence of atherosclerosis, which significantly raises the mortality rate associated with heart diseases. Acute kidney injuries, chronic kidney diseases, end-stage renal diseases, and nephrotic syndromes represent various renal risk factors.\n",

Obesity in children is an emerging problem worldwide, and recent studies have identified early renal dysfunction and risk of CKD in obese children. In addition, low birth weight babies and short gestational ages increase the risk of end-stage renal disease in adolescence. CLINICAL FEATURES Clinical manifestations that are often found in CKD in children are: 1. Growth Disorders Growth disorders are common and perhaps the most frequently seen in children with CKD. The degree of growth impairment increased as GFR decreased, although significant reductions in growth were seen at all levels of renal function. The causes of growth disorders are believed to be multifactorial, including the function of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), nutritional status, acid-base balance, and bone mineralization. Age at onset of CKD correlates with the degree of growth retardation because children with normal kidney function reach one third of adult height\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Reduced Renal Perfusion: Conditions such as hypovolemia (vomiting, diarrhoea, diuretic usage, bleeding), hypotension (resulting from cardiac dysfunction or pericardial disease), and infections like sepsis can lead to reduced blood flow to the kidneys. Additionally, medications that lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), may also contribute to this issue. Early diagnosis through history and physical examination, along with appropriate fluid replacement treatment, can help restore kidney function to its prior level.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Use of Nephrotoxic Drugs: Administration of nephrotoxic substances like aminoglycosides or NSAIDs can negatively impact kidney function. Similarly, exposure to radiographic agents affecting kidneys should be avoided in individuals with compromised kidney function.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT): These anomalies are the primary cause of CKD in children, occurring in approximately 50% of cases. Other contributing factors for CKD in children include hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Low Birth Weight and Short Gestational Ages: Lower birth weights and shorter gestational periods increase the likelihood of developing end-stage renal disease during adolescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Growth Disorder: Children with CKD commonly experience growth issues, which become more severe as kidney function declines. Factors influencing growth problems include growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I functions, nutrition status, acid-base balance, and bone mineralization. The severity of growth impairments increases with a decrease in renal function.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Obesity: Obesity has emerged as a global concern and is associated with early renal dysfunction and an elevated risk of CKD among children.\n",

      "The best type of vascular access for hemodialysis is an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), as it offers longer durability and a reduced risk of complications compared to arteriovenous grafts and catheters. An AVF involves connecting an artery directly to a vein, while an AVG connects an artery to a larger vein using a synthetic tube. Central venous catheters (CVC) are typically reserved for short-term or emergency situations due to their higher risk of infection. The optimal choice of vascular access depends on various factors, including patient's condition, availability of alternatives, and expected longevity of the access. A thorough assessment and early referral for dialysis access are crucial for selecting the most appropriate vascular access method.\n",

Long-term heparin exposure has the potential to cause osteoporosis and may increase the risk of hyperkalemia due to aldosterone inhibition. HEMODIALISIS ALTERNATIVE The hemodiafiltration (HDF) process, a convection method for cleaning toxic substances (a combination of diffusion and ultrafiltration methods) is better than standard hemodialysis. HDF requires good vascular access, with a blood flow rate of 150-240 mL/m2 BSA (Body Surface Area), making it difficult in younger children. To achieve higher flow rates predilutional fluid infusions can be administered; Predilutional hemodiafiltration is more frequently performed in children.

The main cause of CKD in children is congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, followed by hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure, pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy, and hypertension. Optimizing nutritional status with the support of a dietitian is a basic element of care for children with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. The role of a dietitian is to minimize symptoms of uremia, prevent complications of bone disease due to kidney disorders (renal bone disease), and optimize the child's growth.

      "Before performing hemodialysis on a child, several preparations need to be made involving the patient and their family, facilities and infrastructure, tools and supplies, and officers involved. During the procedure, the child's body weight should be checked before and after hemodialysis, trying to achieve the target dry weight after each session. Laboratory tests should also be conducted before and after hemodialysis. After the procedure, blood pressure monitoring, blood test results, and heart function evaluations are performed. In case of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), proper preparation including education on its management by trained professionals is crucial. For CAPD, patients must be prepared for establishing permanent catheter access, considering location, type of catheter, and patient preferences regarding continuing CAPD with dialysis or other options. Early referrals and assessments for insertion sites are vital for those planning to begin CAPD.\n",

Early detection and intervention are very important to slow disease progression and maintain quality of life, but treatment is often delayed due to lack of awareness among the public and medical personnel. The incidence of CKD in each country is different and is estimated to be higher because many cases are not detected.

To prevent hemodialysis catheter infections, precautions like using antiseptics prior to catheter installation, patient and companion screenings for Staphylococcus aureus, prophylactic antibiotics (particularly topical ones), and limiting access to hemodialysis catheters to specialized nurses should be observed. In children, diagnostic management involves examinations including complete blood count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, swab cultures from the catheter exit site or tunnel, and blood culture before beginning antibiotics. Removal of the hemodialysis catheter post-infection follows specific guidelines based on indicators such as persistent infection despite adequate treatment, unresponsive tunnel infection, septic shock, widespread infection, involvement of resistant bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative bacteria, and failure to improve within two weeks of antibiotic therapy. The choice of antibiotic administration relies upon the kind of catheter infection encountered.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "The purpose of perioperative nutritional therapy is to improve the nutritional and metabolic status of patients who are about to undergo surgery. This type of therapy aims to prevent or treat malnutrition in surgical patients, particularly those who cannot consume food for over five days before or after the operation. It also targets individuals with low body mass index (BMI), significant weight loss within six months, or specific assessment grades indicating nutritional risk. Additionally, it helps manage cases where patients struggle to meet their required energy and nutrient intakes orally or via enteral means for extended periods. Perioperative nutritional therapy has been shown to reduce post-surgery infectious and non-infectious complications, especially when initiated 7-14 days prior to elective surgeries. A combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition is advised if oral and tube feeding fail to cover at least half of the daily caloric requirement for more than seven days. Furthermore, special considerations are necessary for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and polyneuropathy, cachexia, and limb defects (PGTCD) patients undergoing or not undergoing renal replacement therapies. Regular monitoring of these patients' nutritional status is crucial due to its impact on their overall health and growth, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts among healthcare professionals involved in managing such conditions.\n",

      "1. Fluid volume status: Overhydration must be completely corrected before surgery through intensive diuretic therapy or pre-operative dialysis. Dehydration can cause severe hypotension during anesthesia induction and subsequent surgery.\n",

Factors causing PEW include decreased protein and energy intake, hypercatabolism, metabolic acidosis, reduced physical activity, decreased anabolism, comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and effects of dialysis therapy. Nutritional status affects post-surgical morbidity and mortality. Malnutrition increases the risk of infection, anastomotic leakage, wound dehiscence, mortality, prolonged care duration, and costs. Inadequate oral intake for over 14 days is associated with high mortality rates. Low preoperative serum albumin levels also indicate a higher risk of complications after surgery due to impaired nutritional status.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases due to underlying risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. CKD itself is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Managing chronic kidney disease aims to treat the primary cause of kidney disorders, eliminate or minimize comorbidities, prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function, treat metabolic disorders associated with chronic kidney disease, prevent and treat cardiovascular disease, and optimize growth and development. Treating hypertension with medications like ACE inhibitors helps protect remaining nephrons from further injury and slows the decline in kidney function. Restricting fluid and salt intake can also help manage the condition. Additionally, proper evaluation and consideration of necessary laboratory parameters before any surgical procedure are crucial for CKD patients, as they face higher risks to their cardiovascular system and kidneys during anesthesia. These risks involve both cardiovascular issues and potential impacts on renal function depending on the severity of kidney impairment and the use of specific drugs affecting renal function.\n",

      "### Response:\n",
      "The contraindications for hemodialysis in children are not clearly mentioned. However, in general, there should be no absolute contraindications for hemodialysis in children. It is crucial to obtain informed consent from the child and their family after explaining the benefits and potential complications associated with hemodialysis procedures. Preparation for hemodialysis involves assessing vital signs, installing appropriate vascular access, ensuring adequate facilities and equipment, and having qualified personnel involved in the process. Post-procedural actions include monitoring body weight changes, conducting necessary lab tests, and adjusting the target dry weight after each hemodialysis session. Additionally, hemodiafiltration (HDF) may be recommended over conventional hemodialysis due to its potential advantages, particularly in reducing cardiovascular mortality. In terms of indications for hemodialysis in pediatric patients with acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease (CKD), it is used when there is fluid overload, serious life-threatening conditions, uncontrolled metabolic disorders, or poisonings requiring removal through the kidneys. The decision to start dialysis in children depends on residual kidney function, laboratory values, psychosocial factors, and optimal timing for kidney transplantation.

      "The standard quality criteria for biology in hemodialysis involve both microbiological and chemical parameters. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Health's regulation, for water used in hemodialysis, the limit for bacterial counts should be no more than 200 colony-forming units (CFU)/milliliter, while the limit for endotoxin count is less than 2 endotoxin units (EU)/milliliter. For ultrapure water with high flux, the bacterial count limit is less than 0.1 CFU/milliliter, and the endotoxin count limit is less than 0.03 EU/milliliter. For dialysate, the bacterial count limit is less than 200 CFU/milliliter, whereas for ultrapure dialysate with high flux, the bacterial count limit is less than 0.1 CFU/milliliter, and the endotoxin count limit is less than 0.03 EU/milliliter. As for the chemical quality standards for hemodialysis, some examples include calcium at a maximum concentration of 2 milligrams per liter, magnesium at 4 milligrams per liter, sodium (salt) at 70 milligrams per liter, potassium at 8 milligrams per liter, and so forth. These standards ensure safe and effective usage of water in medical devices across various healthcare settings.\n",

      "The goals of nutritional therapy can be achieved with nutritional counseling and individual assessment. Interventions are carried out based on the results of assessments of nutritional status, age, development, food choices, beliefs and psychosocial status. Children with CKD need to be evaluated periodically with nutritional modifications. Evaluations are more often carried out for worsening CKD, the presence of comorbidities that affect growth, and diseases that cause impaired nutritional status. Nutritional therapy is carried out in collaboration between pediatricians, pediatric nurses, nutritionists and a team of pediatric nephrologists. EPIDEMIOLOGY The average incidence of CKD in children in the world is 12.1 cases per 1,000,000 children. The incidence of CKD at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in 1986-1988 was 21 out of 252 children6. The incidence of end-stage renal failure in children in America, New Zealand, Austria and Japan respectively is 14.8; 13.6; 12.4; and 4 per 1,000,000 children. One of the causes of the difference in incidence rates is the existence of screening programs and the ease of kidney transplantation5. The most common cause of CKD in children under five years of age is congenital abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary tract, including renal dysplasia, renal hypoplasia, and obstructive uropathy due to posterior urethral valves. In children over five years old, CKD is most often caused by acquired diseases, such as glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections. THERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS In 2008,\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (PGKD) is diagnosed in children aged 5-12 years based on hemoglobin levels below 11.5 grams per deciliter. Management of this condition involves nutritional therapy through personalized counseling and assessments considering various factors like child's age, nutritional status, food preferences, beliefs, and psychological aspects. Regular evaluations are crucial especially when CKD worsens, coexisting health issues impact growth, or any other situation affecting proper nutrition. Collaborative efforts among pediatricians, pediatric nurses, nutritionists, and pediatric nephrology teams contribute significantly to managing PGKD. The global prevalence of childhood CKD stands around 12.1 cases per million kids, while specific numbers vary across regions influenced by factors such as availability of screening programs and accessibility to kidney transplantation. Congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies are the leading cause of CKD in young children under five, whereas older children typically experience acquired diseases like glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections. Treatment strategies involve controlling high blood pressure starting from minimal doses, adjusting medications if needed, adding diuretics for fluid retention and sodium imbalance, monitoring electrolyte and creatinine levels during treatment, and incorporating beta-blockers alongside alpha-blockers in case of hyperadrenergic conditions. Lifestyle modifications, such as low-salt diets and regular exercises within individual tolerance, also play a significant role in managing childhood hypertension. Iron and folic acid deficiencies, shortened red blood cells, bone mineral disorders, aluminum toxicity, elevated hepcidin levels, and impaired erythropoiesis due to reduced kidney function are some factors contributing to anemia development in children with CKD.\n",

The aim of nutritional therapy for children with CKD is to achieve normal growth and development through providing adequate nutrition. The parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD are: a. Food intake Food intake needs to be considered in order to achieve optimal growth. Adequacy of food intake is assessed by recording and evaluating for three consecutive days. b. Height/body length percentile for age Height/body length assessment was carried out using the WHO standard growth curve for children from birth to five years of age and the CDC growth curve for children over five years of age.

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restriction of sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization. The recommendation for giving calcium is 100% -200% of daily needs according to age. CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency are advised to receive vitamin D by monitoring serum vitamin D3 levels.

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restriction of sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization. The recommendation for giving calcium is 100% -200% of daily needs according to age. CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency are advised to receive vitamin D by monitoring serum vitamin D3 levels.

      "The goals of nutritional therapy can be achieved with nutritional counseling and individual assessment. Interventions are carried out based on the results of assessments of nutritional status, age, development, food choices, beliefs and psychosocial status. Children with CKD need to be evaluated periodically with nutritional modifications. Evaluations are more often carried out for worsening CKD, the presence of comorbidities that affect growth, and diseases that cause impaired nutritional status. Nutritional therapy is carried out in collaboration between pediatricians, pediatric nurses, nutritionists and a team of pediatric nephrologists. EPIDEMIOLOGY The average incidence of CKD in children in the world is 12.1 cases per 1,000,000 children. The incidence of CKD at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in 1986-1988 was 21 out of 252 children6. The incidence of end-stage renal failure in children in America, New Zealand, Austria and Japan respectively is 14.8; 13.6; 12.4; and 4 per 1,000,000 children. One of the causes of the difference in incidence rates is the existence of screening programs and the ease of kidney transplantation5. The most common cause of CKD in children under five years of age is congenital abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary tract, including renal dysplasia, renal hypoplasia, and obstructive uropathy due to posterior urethral valves. In children over five years old, CKD is most often caused by acquired diseases, such as glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections. THERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS In 2008,\n",

      "the National Kidney Foundation published guidelines for managing CKD in children. Management includes monitoring blood pressure, lipid levels, and electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring should also be done for complications such as anemia, bone disease, and progressive renal insufficiency. Treatment depends on the stage of CKD. For stages 1-2, treatment focuses on controlling hypertension and reducing proteinuria. Stage 3 requires regular follow-up, dietary management, and control of blood pressure. At stage 4, dialysis is needed, while stage 5 requires renal replacement therapy.\n",

      "### Response:\n",
      "Causes of reduced calorie intake in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients include decreased appetite and vomiting. Factors affecting appetite in CKD patients involve children prioritizing thirst over hunger due to polyuria, preference for salty foods instead of sweet ones as they seek increased energy intake, accumulation of appetite-regulating cytokines and hormones, gastroesophageal reflux, gastrointestinal motility disorders like delayed gastric emptying, and drug effects. To address these issues, it is crucial to provide appropriate nutritional support tailored to each patient's specific needs. Periodic evaluations of nutritional status, adjustments in energy requirements depending on weight gain or loss, additional nutrition when necessary through feeding tubes, and balancing calories are essential components of nutritional therapy for CKD patients. This multifaceted approach typically involves collaborative efforts among pediatricians, pediatric nurses, nutritionists, and pediatric nephrology teams.\n",

The aim of nutritional therapy for children with CKD is to achieve normal growth and development through providing adequate nutrition. The parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD are: a. Food intake Food intake needs to be considered in order to achieve optimal growth. Adequacy of food intake is assessed by recording and evaluating for three consecutive days. b. Height/body length percentile for age Height/body length assessment was carried out using the WHO standard growth curve for children from birth to five years of age and the CDC growth curve for children over five years of age.

      "The interval for nutritional assessment for an infant under one year of age with CKD stages 2 to 5 and on dialysis (5D) is recommended to be evaluated every 0.5 to 3 months. For children aged 1 to 3 years with CKD, the nutritional evaluation should be conducted every 1 to 3 months. As for older children between ages 4 to 18 years depending on their CKD stage, the frequency of nutritional assessment ranges from every 3 to 6 months up to every 12 months. These recommendations include evaluating aspects such as food intake, height or body length percentiles, estimated dry weight and body weight percentiles, body mass index, head circumference percentile, energy needs, vitamins and minerals requirements, protein needs, bone health, fluid needs and electrolyte balance, and anemia management.

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restricting sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization. The recommendation for giving calcium is 100% -200% of daily needs according to age. CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency are advised to receive vitamin D by monitoring serum vitamin D3 levels.

Firstly, these children might have a sedentary lifestyle with limited exposure to sunlight, leading to reduced vitamin D synthesis in their skin. Secondly, they could have insufficient intake of vitamin D-rich foods. Thirdly, decreased vitamin D production occurs in the skin of uremia patients. Lastly, there's loss of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]-vitamin D) and its binding proteins in nephritis patients through urine. To manage this deficiency, continuous vitamin D administration should be provided while monitoring serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-[OH]-vitamin D) levels annually.

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious health problem in children with increasing morbidity and mortality and causing significant socio-economic problems. The main cause of CKD in children is congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, followed by hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure, pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy, and hypertension. Optimizing nutritional status with the support of a dietitian is a basic element of care for children with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. The role of a dietitian is to minimize symptoms of uremia, prevent complications of bone disease due to kidney disorders (renal bone disease), and optimize the child's growth.

A multicentre European study has found that the first priorities for PD were child's age (30%), parental preference (27%), distance from unit (14%), patient preference (11%), social conditions (7%), and no can do one mode (6%). Choosing a dialysis mode, whether HD or PD, for a child requires consideration, among other factors, of the possible impact of either dialysis mode on the maintenance of residual renal function (RRF), due to its specific impact on patient outcomes. Although there is no general consensus, peritoneal dialysis is associated with less risk of RRF loss. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure (e.g. encephalopathy, seizures, foot drop), pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy. , and hypertension. The side effects of uremia, namely fatigue and weakness, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal symptoms, are relative indications for the initiation of dialysis. PEDIATRIC HEMODIALISIS There are several basic differences between adult and pediatric hemodialysis. For example, in pediatrics, blood flow and hemodialyzers are selected on the basis that children can tolerate 8% (maximum 10%) of their total blood volume in the extracorporeal circuit based on an estimated total blood volume of 80 mL/kg for infants\n",

In some European countries, hemodialysis (HD) is more often performed for children over the age of five. HD is not offered to children less than 5 years of age unless there is a substantial contra-indication to peritoneal dialysis (PD).

As glomerular filtration rate declines, growth impairments become more pronounced, though significant reduction in growth may occur even at all stages of renal function. Factors contributing to growth issues in CKD children involve growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I functions, nutrition status, acid-base balance, and bone mineralization. Other clinical features in CKD children include potential metabolic acidosis, necessitating bicarbonate supplementation to maintain serum bicarbonate levels within 24-26mmol/L range.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) defined CKD as a structural or functional kidney abnormality that lasts more than 3 months. However, this definition does not apply to children under 2 years of age, whose nephrons are immature. Also, babies born with congenital kidney anomalies may be diagnosed with CKD before reaching 3 months of age. NKF-KDOQI divides CKD into five stages, namely: Stage 1: kidney damage with normal GFR or increased GFR (≥90 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 2: kidney damage with mild decrease in GFR (60-89 mL/minute /1.73 m²) Stage 3: moderate decrease in GFR (30-59 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 4: severe decrease in GFR (15-29 mL/minute/1.73 m²) Stage 5: kidney failure ( GFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m² or dialysis) An important difference between adult and pediatric end-stage renal disease is the etiology of CKD.

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restriction of sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization. The recommendation for giving calcium is 100% -200% of daily needs according to age. CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency are advised to receive vitamin D by monitoring serum vitamin D3 levels.

      "4. Corticosteroids The use of corticosteroids can suppress growth in children with CKD because their effect is to suppress growth hormone by stimulating hypothalamic somatostatin, decreasing regulation of hepatic growth hormone receptors, inhibiting the biological activity of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), disrupting the balance of the serum IGF binding protein profile. , and direct suppressive effects on local growth factors and tissue matrix production. Discontinuation of corticosteroids or modification of the corticosteroid dose is important to achieve optimal growth. a. In children with CKD grades 2-5 and 5D, serum bicarbonate needs to be corrected to normal. Chronic kidney disease causes metabolic acidosis which results in impaired growth. In a state of acidosis, thyroid hormone will decrease and the IGF response to recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is also blunted, resulting in resistance to endogenous growth hormone and rhGH. In addition, in conditions of acidosis, protein catabolism will increase accompanied by increased calcium excretion from bones and decreased albumin synthesis. b. Growth hormone therapy needs to be considered in children with CKD grades 2-5 and 5D, short stature, and the potential for failure to thrive. The growth hormone IGF-1 is an important regulator of growth and metabolism. Disruption of this hormone causes resistance to growth hormone, including decreased expression\n",

Firstly, it puts them at risk of malnutrition, growth delay, and nutritional disorders, increasing the likelihood of illness and death. Secondly, certain medications used to manage CKD, like corticosteroids, can hinder growth due to their suppression of growth hormones. Thirdly, metabolic acidosis caused by CKD may lead to impaired growth. To address these issues, proper nutritional management, adjustment of medication doses if necessary, and potentially growth hormone therapies might be considered depending on the severity of the case. Additionally, prevention efforts should begin even before birth through collaborative efforts among healthcare professionals, parents, educators, and communities.\n",

      "For most babies and children weighing less than 10 kg, more than three dialysis sessions a week have been shown to meet nutritional needs; Because the milk consumed by children is also water, 4 to 5 dialysis times a week are often required. The amount and duration of each dialysis session must be able to avoid the need for fasting in order to achieve the body weight needed to support the short duration of dialysis. The volume of fluid for extracorporeal blood replacement at the end of the session should be limited, preferably glucose solution over saline solution, especially in infants without remaining functioning kidneys. Dialysis should be considered as part of an overall treatment strategy including adequate diet and interdialytic therapy.

      "Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the most commonly used anticoagulant during hemodialysis. It helps prevent blood clots from forming within the dialysis machine's circulation system, ensuring smooth and efficient filtration processes. While low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) have gained popularity for their predictable anticoagulant effects and reduced need for routine laboratory monitoring, they may require hospitalization for some patients with thrombosis. However, LMWH presents advantages like lower occurrence of thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced osteoporosis when compared to UFH. Notably, UFH inhibits both factor Xa and thrombin, whereas LMWH predominantly targets factor Xa. Moreover, UFH's elimination occurs through liver and kidney mechanisms, making it suitable for various populations. The appropriate dosage of anticoagulants should consider the type and size of the membrane being used, along with the specific dialysis method employed.\n",

      "### Response:\n",
      "Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the most frequently utilized anticoagulant for use during hemodialysis procedures. Its primary function is to prevent the formation of blood clots inside the dialysis equipment's circulatory system, thereby maintaining effective and uninterrupted filtration processes. Although Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) have gained prominence for their foreseeable anticoagulant properties and diminished requirement for regular lab monitoring, these might necessitate hospitalization for certain individuals dealing with thrombosis. Furthermore, LMWH offers benefits such as a lower likelihood of developing thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced osteoporosis compared to UFH. Distinctively, UFH inhibits both Factor Xa and Thrombin, while LMWH primarily affects Factor Xa. Additionally, UFH gets eliminated through liver and kidney pathways, rendering it suitable for diverse patient groups. When determining the optimal dosage of anticoagulants, one needs to take into consideration the kind and scale of the membrane being used alongside the particular dialysis approach implemented.\n",

      "Disequilibrium Syndrome is a complication that occurs due to an imbalance caused by rapid removal of waste products from the body during the initial stages of hemodialysis therapy in patients with kidney failure. It mainly affects children but can also occur in adults. Gejala Disequilibrium Syndrome are varied and can appear suddenly, including headaches or seizures, nausea or vomiting, fatigue, drowsiness, high blood pressure with narrow fluctuations between systolic and diastolic pressures. This condition can be prevented by maintaining low blood flow rates during the first session, keeping the duration short (no more than three hours), and adjusting according to ultrafiltration needs. If needed, mannitol injection can help prevent this syndrome. Symptoms typically disappear a few hours after ending the dialysis process. Other factors such as premedication, blood line volume, choice of dialyzer / hemofilter, priming fluid calculation, and extracorporeal volume play crucial roles in managing and preventing Disruption Syndrome.\n",

The main cause of CKD in children is congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, followed by hereditary nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. Absolute indications for initiating dialysis in children include anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurological disorders in renal failure, pericarditis, bleeding diathesis, recurrent nausea, symptoms of uremia, volume overload, or failure to thrive despite appropriate medical therapy, and hypertension. Optimizing nutritional status with the support of a dietitian is a basic element of care for children with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. The role of a dietitian is to minimize symptoms of uremia, prevent complications of bone disease due to kidney disorders (renal bone disease), and optimize the child's growth.

      "The role of ACE inhibitors in managing hypertension in chronic kidney disease involves protecting the remaining nephrons from further harm and slowing down the decline in kidney function. They are used when a child's blood pressure exceeds the 95th percentile for their age, height, and gender. In addition to controlling high blood pressure, these medications help protect other parts of the kidney from injury. Fluid and sodium restriction can also lower high blood pressure. In chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors play a part in treating hypertension, but they are just one component of a larger strategy involving primary treatment of the kidney disorder and preventing or slowing its impact on brain development. These medications maintain both anti-hypertensive effects and protect against further impairment of other kidney functions. Their use is recommended if a child's blood pressure is above the 95th percentile for their age, height, and sex. Alongside this, regulating fluids and salt levels can also reduce elevated blood pressure.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is kidney damage characterized by abnormalities in the pathology of the kidney anatomy and abnormalities in kidney function that last for three months or more. Children with CKD are at risk of experiencing malnutrition, growth delays and nutritional disorders. This situation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional therapy for children with CKD aims to maintain optimal nutritional status; adequate supply of micronutrients and macronutrients; avoid uremic toxicity, abnormal metabolism, and malnutrition; and reduce the risk of chronic morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Parameters for assessing nutritional status and growth in children with CKD include food intake, percentile of height/body length for age, percentile of speed of increase in height/body length for age, estimated body weight and weight percentile for age, body mass index, and head circumference. Restricting sodium intake is recommended for CKD children who suffer from prehypertension or hypertension. Phosphate restriction is useful for preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism and is safe for growth, nutrition and bone mineralization. The recommendation for giving calcium is 100% -200% of daily needs according to age. CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency are advised to receive vitamin D by monitoring serum vitamin D3 levels.

For children with stage 3 CKD, they generally require between 1.5 to 2.1 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. In stages 4-5, this decreases slightly to between 1.5 to 1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. However, these values may differ based on individual cases such as those receiving peritoneal dialysis. It's crucial to consult healthcare professionals for personalized dietary recommendations considering each child's unique health circumstances.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "The management of dyslipidemia in pediatric chronic kidney disease (PGTA) patients on peritoneal dialysis ranges from 29% to 87%. Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia affect around 90% and 69% of CKD children respectively. To prevent or treat dyslipidemia in CKD kids, several approaches may be taken, which includes limiting their sugar intake, using soybean oil, corn, or unsaturated fats for cooking, consuming more fish, removing chicken skin, choosing lean meats, restricting high-calorie sauces, opting for whole grain bread and cereals instead of other carbohydrates, preferring nuts and tofu over meat, scrutinizing food labels for low salt, sugar content, and high fiber diets, and considering a balanced diet rich in proteins, carbohydrates, and fats to avoid calorie deficiency. However, in cases where CKD children have normal nutritional status, dietary intervention for dyslipidemia isn't advised unless they follow a healthy fat diet. For overweight or obese CKD stages 2-5 and 5D kids, lipid restriction and lifestyle modifications for weight gain or loss should be implemented. Extra nourishment might also be provided when food intake is insufficient, through feeding tubes if needed, to meet energy requirements. Maintaining a proper balance between carbohydrates, proteins, and fats is crucial because an imbalance raises risks of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes. Dyslipidemia management is essential in CKD children to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases, which is the primary cause of mortality among end-stage renal disease patients.\n",

      "A diet rich in fiber has multiple benefits for digestive health. It can prevent constipation by increasing stool bulk and softness, making it easier to pass. Fiber also promotes gut health by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria in the digestive system. Additionally, high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help control blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol. Soluble fiber in these foods slows sugar absorption and binds cholesterol in the intestines. Furthermore, a high-fiber diet can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by speeding up the removal of carcinogenic substances from the colon, thereby reducing the exposure time of colon cells to harmful materials.\n",

      "Nutrition Recommendations for Children with End-Stage Kidney DiseaseEnergy: Babies (0-1 years) need between 108 to kcal/kg body weight (BW) per day for 0-0.5 years old, and more than kcal/kg BW per day for ages 0.5-1 year. Toddlers (1-3 years) need around 102 kcal/kg BW per day. Children (3-10 years) need around 90 kcal/kg BW per day for ages 4-6 years, and 70 kcal/kg BW per day for ages 7-10 years. Adolescents (11-18 years) need around 47 kcal/kg BW per day for girls aged 11-14 years, 40 kcal/kg BW per day for girls aged 15-18 years, 55 kcal/kg BW per day for boys aged 11-14 years, and 45 kcal/kg BW per day for boys aged 15-18 years. Protein: Babies (0-1 years) need around 2, 2 g/kg BW per day for ages 0-0.5 years, and 1.6 g/kg BW per day for ages 0.5-1 years. Toddlers (1-3 years) need around 1.2 g/kg BW per day.Children (3-10 years) need around 1.2 g/kg BW per day for ages 4-6 years, and 1.0 g/kg BW per day for ages 7-10 years.Teenagers (11- 18 years) requires around 1.0 g/kg BW per day for ages 11-14 years, and 0.9 g/kg BW per day for ages 15-18 years. Sodium: For all age groups, sodium generally does not need to be limited , but can reach 1-3 mEq/kg BW per day if edema or hypertension occurs. Potassium: Potassium usually does not need to be limited until kidney function levels (GFR) are less than 10% of normal, with an amount of around 1-3 mEq/kg BW if needed. Calcium: Babies (0-1 years) need around 400 mg/day for ages 0-0.5 years, and 600 mg/day for ages 0.5-1 years. Toddlers (1-3 years) need around 800 mg/day. Children (3-10 years) need around 800 mg/day. Adolescents (11-18 years) need around 1200 mg/day. This applies if there is no hypercalcemia and the calcium-phosphorus product does not exceed 70. Phosphorus: For all age groups, use a low-phosphorus formula if serum phosphate levels are elevated, and avoid foods high in phosphorus. Approximately 600-800 mg/day is usually required when serum phosphate levels rise. Vitamins: For all age groups, administer multivitamins if necessary. Administer vitamin D metabolites as needed, based on calcium, PTH, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Micro Minerals: For all age groups, provide zinc, iron, or copper supplements as needed.\n",
